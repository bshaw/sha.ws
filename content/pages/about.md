I'm Brian Shaw, a human being with an identity influenced by a broad set of factors and interests.

World travel, beer, brewing, concerts, and cycling (for leisure and commute) top my list of favourite things.
I live in London with my amazing wife and two super-awesome kids, with whom I do nearly everyhing.

I currently work as a Senior Cloud Solutions Architect for [Virtusa](https://cloud.virtusa.com), where I provide technical leadership for teams and organisations who are transforming their business through adoption of public cloud, DevOps, and Site Reliability Engineering.
I specialize in infrastructure as code, containers, configuration management, and automating the boring stuff.
I'm most likely to be writing (in no particular order) Terraform, Chef, Bash, Python, and Ruby.
