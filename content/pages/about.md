I'm Brian Shaw, a human being with an identity influenced by a broad set of factors and interests.

World travel, beer, brewing, concerts, and cycling (for leisure and commute) top my list of favourite things.
I live in London with my amazing wife and two super-awesome kids, with whom I do nearly everyhing.

I currently work as the Head of Technical Architecture for [Hometrack](https://www.hometrack.com/uk/) (part of [Zoopla](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/)), where I provide technical leadership and architectural oversight for our products and platforms.
I specialize in public cloud, infrastructure as code, containers, configuration management, and automating the boring stuff.
